[Direction](#direction) | The text direction in which to display the notification.
[IconUri](#iconuri) | A string containing the URI of an icon to be displayed in the notification.
[IsSilent](#issilent) | Indicates whether the notification should be silent -- i.e., no sounds or vibrations should be issued, regardless of the device settings.
[Language](#language) | The notification's language, as intended to be specified using a string representing a language tag (such as `en-US`) according to [BCP47](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646).
[RequiresInteraction](#requiresinteraction) | A boolean value indicating that a notification should remain active until the user clicks or dismisses it, rather than closing automatically.

[Timestamp](#timestamp) | 
[Title](#title) | The title of the notification.
[VibrationPattern](#vibrationpattern) | Activates a persistent notification with a given action with the specified action index.
[ReportClicked](#reportclicked) | The host may run this to report the notification has been clicked, and it will cause the [click](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notification/click_event) event to be raised for non-persistent notifications.
[ReportClosed](#reportclosed) | The host may run this to report the notification was dismissed, and it will cause the [close](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notification/close_event) event to be raised for non-persistent notifications.
[ReportShown](#reportshown) | The host may run this to report the notification has been displayed and it will cause the [show](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notification/show_event) event to be raised for non-persistent notifications.

## Methods

### ReportClicked

> void ReportClicked()

The host may run this to report the notification has been clicked, and it will cause the [click](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notification/click_event) event to be raised for non-persistent notifications.
You must not run this unless you are handling the [CoreWebView2.NotificationReceived](corewebview2.md#notificationreceived). API throws COMException with error code of `HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INVALID_STATE)` if [CoreWebView2NotificationReceivedEventArgs.Handled](corewebview2notificationreceivedeventargs.md#handled) is `false` or [CoreWebView2Notification.ReportShown](corewebview2notification.md#reportshown) has not been run when this is called.



### ReportClosed

> void ReportClosed()

The host may run this to report the notification was dismissed, and it will cause the [close](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notification/close_event) event to be raised for non-persistent notifications.
You must not run this unless you are handling the [CoreWebView2.NotificationReceived](corewebview2.md#notificationreceived). API throws COMException with error code of `HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INVALID_STATE)` if [CoreWebView2NotificationReceivedEventArgs.Handled](corewebview2notificationreceivedeventargs.md#handled) is `false` or [CoreWebView2Notification.ReportShown](corewebview2notification.md#reportshown) has not been run when this is called.



### ReportShown

> void ReportShown()

The host may run this to report the notification has been displayed and it will cause the [show](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notification/show_event) event to be raised for non-persistent notifications.
You must not run this unless you are handling the [CoreWebView2.NotificationReceived](corewebview2.md#notificationreceived). API throws COMException with error code of `HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INVALID_STATE)` if [CoreWebView2NotificationReceivedEventArgs.Handled](corewebview2notificationreceivedeventargs.md#handled) is `false` when this is called.




## Events

### CloseRequested

This event is raised when the notification is closed by the web code, such as through `notification.close()`.
You don't need to call [CoreWebView2Notification.ReportClosed](corewebview2notification.md#reportclosed) since this is coming from the web code.

Type: [TypedEventHandler](/uwp/api/Windows.Foundation.TypedEventHandler-2)&lt;CoreWebView2Notification, Object&gt;
