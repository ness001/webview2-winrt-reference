## Properties

### BytesReceived

> readonly  int64_t BytesReceived

The number of bytes that have been written to the download file.

### CanResume

> readonly  bool CanResume

Returns true if an interrupted download can be resumed.
Downloads with the following interrupt reasons may automatically resume without you calling any methods: [CoreWebView2DownloadInterruptReason](corewebview2downloadinterruptreason.md).ServerNoRange, [CoreWebView2DownloadInterruptReason](corewebview2downloadinterruptreason.md).FileHashMismatch, [CoreWebView2DownloadInterruptReason](corewebview2downloadinterruptreason.md).FileTooShort. In these cases progress may be restarted with [CoreWebView2DownloadOperation.BytesReceived](corewebview2downloadoperation.md#bytesreceived) set to 0.

### ContentDisposition

> readonly  string ContentDisposition

The Content-Disposition header value from the download's HTTP response. If none, the value is an empty string.

### EstimatedEndTime

> readonly  string EstimatedEndTime

The estimated end time of the download.

### InterruptReason

> readonly  [CoreWebView2DownloadInterruptReason](corewebview2downloadinterruptreason.md) InterruptReason

The reason why connection with file host was broken.
See [CoreWebView2DownloadInterruptReason](corewebview2downloadinterruptreason.md) for descriptions of reasons.

### MimeType

> readonly  string MimeType

MIME type of the downloaded content.

### ResultFilePath

> readonly  string ResultFilePath

The absolute path to the download file, including file name.
Host can change this from [CoreWebView2DownloadStartingEventArgs.ResultFilePath](corewebview2downloadstartingeventargs.md#resultfilepath).

### State

> readonly  [CoreWebView2DownloadState](corewebview2downloadstate.md) State

The state of the download. A download can be in progress, interrupted, or completed.
See [CoreWebView2DownloadState](corewebview2downloadstate.md) for descriptions of states.

### TotalBytesToReceive

> readonly  int64_t TotalBytesToReceive

The expected size of the download in total number of bytes based on the HTTP Content-Length header.
Returns null if the size is unknown.

### Uri

> readonly  string Uri

The URI of the download.



## Methods

### Cancel

> void Cancel()

Cancels the download.
If canceled, the default download dialog shows that the download was canceled. Host should use [CoreWebView2DownloadStartingEventArgs.Cancel](corewebview2downloadstartingeventargs.md#cancel) if download should be canceled without displaying the default download dialog.



### Pause

> void Pause()

Pauses the download.
If paused, the default download dialog shows that the download is paused. No effect if download is already paused. Pausing a download changes the state from in progress to interrupted, with interrupt reason set to [CoreWebView2DownloadInterruptReason](corewebview2downloadinterruptreason.md).UserCanceled.



### Resume

> void Resume()

Resumes a paused download. May also resume a download that was interrupted for another reason if [CoreWebView2DownloadOperation.CanResume](corewebview2downloadoperation.md#canresume) returns true.
Resuming a download changes the state from interrupted to in progress.




## Events
