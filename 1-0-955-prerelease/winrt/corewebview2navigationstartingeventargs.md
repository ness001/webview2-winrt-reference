--|--

## Properties

### Cancel

>  bool Cancel

Determines whether to cancel the navigation.

If set to `true`, the navigation is no longer present and the content of the current page is intact. For performance reasons, `GET` HTTP requests may happen, while the host is responding. You may set cookies and use part of a request for the navigation. Cancellation for navigation to `about:blank` or frame navigation to srcdoc is not supported and ignored.

### IsRedirected

> readonly  bool IsRedirected

`true` when the navigation is redirected.

### IsUserInitiated

> readonly  bool IsUserInitiated

`true` when the navigation was initiated through a user gesture as opposed to programmatic navigation.

### NavigationId

> readonly  uint64_t NavigationId

Gets the ID of the navigation.

### RequestHeaders

> readonly  [CoreWebView2HttpRequestHeaders](corewebview2httprequestheaders.md) RequestHeaders

Gets the HTTP request headers for the navigation.

Note, you are not able to modify the HTTP request headers in a [CoreWebView2.NavigationStarting](corewebview2.md#navigationstarting) event.

### Uri

> readonly  string Uri

Gets the uri of the requested navigation.
